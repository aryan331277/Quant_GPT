Modeling was done using both symmetrical and asymmetrical \ngeneralized auto regressive Heteroskedastic model (GARCH) models; these were \nGARCH (1,1), E-GARCH (1,1) and P-GARCH (1,1). The findings showed that all three \n(3) models were significant to forecast stock returns volatility at DSE. GARCH (1,1) and \nP-GARCH (1,1) both revealed that the magnitude of shocks in volatility is higher with \ngood news as opposed to bad news. E-GARCH model (1,1) showed the evidence of \nleverage effect associated with the stock returns which can be detrimental to the trading \ncompanies\u2019 capital structures. P-GARCH (1,1) was found to be more accurate to in \npredicting stock returns based on both the Root Mean Squares Error (RMSE) and Theil \nInequality Coefficient (TIC).

INTRODUCTION \nVolatility refers to the amount of risk or uncertainty pertaining to the variations in a \nsecurity\u2019s value. Some securities are highly volatile which implies that their values \nfluctuate over a larger range of values while others are less volatile which means that \ntheir values can be spread out over s smaller range of values.",
  "Keywords: Volatility, Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE), GARCH. Received 28 November 2018 | Revised 22 February 2019 | Accepted 13 May 2019. 1. INTRODUCTION \nVolatility refers to the amount of risk or uncertainty pertaining to the variations in a \nsecurity\u2019s value. Some securities are highly volatile which implies that their values \nfluctuate over a larger range of values while others are less volatile which means that \ntheir values can be spread out over s smaller range of values. Fama (1965) depict that this \nvariation/deviation of securities\u2019 returns are not directly observable hence it\u2019s the duty of \ntraders, institutional investors and other participants to have an understanding of the \nnature of the returns between return and volatility. The Global growth of stock markets has aroused interest among researchers and \npractitioners about modeling volatility of stock returns. Modeling volatility forms a vital \npart of designing investment plans to reduce risk and improve stock returns and it is also \nvery useful in securities and options pricing. However, its importance is not only \nconfined to investors and other market participants, but also to the overall economy as \nwell. High levels of volatility tend to distort stability of capital markets, destabilize \ncurrency value and hinder international trade (Bhowmik, 2013). --- Page 2 ---\nReview of Integrative Business and Economics Research, Vol. 9, Issue 2 \n139 \n \nCopyright \uf6d9 2020 GMP Press and Printing \nISSN: 2304-1013 (Online); 2304-1269 (CDROM); 2414-6722 (Print) \n \nOver the years numerous models have been devised by researchers seeking to model \nvolatility in stock returns, these have been grouped into symmetrical and non-\nsymmetrical models.

The financial analysts, investors \nand other key players in the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) will be able to get \nsome insights on how stock returns behave so that they can be in a position to predict \nfuture behavior. This will help these market players to improve stock returns using \nscientific means rather than just predicting stock price behavior on individual intuition or \ngut feeling. 1.3 Overview of Dar Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) \nThe Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) is a stock exchange located Dar es Salaam \nCity, Tanzania.

Tamilselvan & Vali (2016) forecasted stock market volatility using four (4) indices from \nMuscat security market in the period 2001-2015. The study made use of GARCH, \nEGARCH and TGARCH  models and results revealed a  positive relationship between \nrisk and return. The findings further showed that GARCH models generated significant \nevidence of asymmetrical relationship between return shocks and volatility adjustments \nin all four (4) indices. Wagala et al (2012) examined stock volatility at Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) by \nemploying the ARCH and GARCH models.

On the other hand, P-GARCH (1,1) has also the \nlowest TIC compared to the other two (2) forecasting models. TIC ranges from 0 to 1 and \nthe smaller it is, the smaller is the difference between observed values and forecasted \nvalues hence more accuracy. So in this case the argument can be made that P-GARCH \n(1,1) is more accurate in forecasting stock returns volatility at DSE. 4.9 Conclusions \nStock markets play an important role by enabling companies to raise extra capital from \nthe public which enables them to expand their operations, increasing national income by \npaying taxes from profits and employ more people.

Benefits from stock markets are not \nonly confined to listed companies but also investors, brokers and the economy as well. So \na well-functioning stock market is crucial for economic development especially of \ndeveloping countries such as Tanzania. One of the key issues that concerns market participants is that of volatility of stock \nreturns. Highly volatile markets lower investors\u2019 confidence hence affecting the total \nmarket capitalization due to fear of losses due to the unpredictability of the markets. Stock markets that are less volatile are considered to be stable and create investors\u2019 \nconfidence which increases their propensity to invest their funds. So the crucial aspect \namong experts is to understand the behavior or volatility of stock returns by forecasting \nor modeling them so that proper decisions can be made based on strong grounds. For \ninstance options can be correctly priced if volatility is well forecasted which can help \ndealers and investors improve their profits. This study has modeled volatility of stock returns at DSE using both symmetrical and \nasymmetrical models so as to ensure that the most efficient forecasting model is \nidentified and put into use in this case the P-GARCH (1,1) was found to be more accurate \nas opposed to GARCH (1,1) and P-GARCH (1,1). So DSE participants are urged to apply \nthis model in their efforts to forecast stock returns volatility and reduce uncertainties \nassociated with these returns.",
