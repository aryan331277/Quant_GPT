We show that this view is incomplete: LETF performance depends fundamentally\non return autocorrelation and return dynamics. In markets with independent returns, LETFs\nexhibit positive expected compounding e\ufb00ects on their target multiples. In serially correlated\nmarkets, trends enhance returns, while mean reversion induces underperformance. With a uni-\n\ufb01ed framework incorporating AR(1) and AR-GARCH models, continuous-time regime switching,\nand \ufb02exible rebalancing frequencies, we demonstrate that return dynamics\u2014including return au-\ntocorrelation, volatility clustering, and regime persistence\u2014determine whether LETFs outper-\nform or underperform their targets. Empirically, using about 20 years of SPDR S&P 500 ETF\nand Nasdaq-100 ETF data, we con\ufb01rm these theoretical predictions.

See also U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (2009) for an alert announcement from SEC regarding the riskiness of\nLETFs. Prior studies have primarily focused on volatility drag as the dominant driver of LETF\nunderperformance, e.g., see Jarrow (2010), Charupat and Miu (2011), Trainor (2017), often em-\nphasizing the negative e\ufb00ects of rebalancing on long-term returns. However, we argue that this conventional view is incomplete. The literature has placed less\nemphasis on aspects of return behavior that fundamentally alter LETF performance dynamics. For example, Lu et al. (2009) showed empirically that LETFs can meet their leverage targets over\nhorizons shorter than a month but may deviate when held beyond a quarter.

(2023) studied an optimal\nrebalancing model for LETFs under market closure and frictions. Yet these analyses fail to fully\ncharacterize the mechanism driving LETF performance. Throughout this paper, we use the term return dynamics to refer broadly to the time-series\nstructure of returns\u2014including independent returns, serial dependence (e.g., autocorrelation), volatil-\nity clustering (e.g., GARCH e\ufb00ects), and regime-driven variation in drift and volatility. This en-\ncompasses both stationary i.i.d. settings and more complex dynamic models such as AR-GARCH\nand regime-switching processes\nWe demonstrate that return autocorrelation and return dynamics play a primary role in driving\ncompounding deviations under realistic return dynamics. Speci\ufb01cally, in markets with independent\nreturns, we show that LETFs exhibit positive expected compounding e\ufb00ects to their target multi-\nples, contrary to conventional wisdom.

Section 2 develops the theoretical framework\nfor analyzing the compounding e\ufb00ect under di\ufb00erent return structures. Section 3 presents both\ntheoretical analysis and simulations to evaluate LETF performance.

This deviation reveals the\nimportance of understanding LETF performance beyond short-term horizons. Example 2.1 (Daily Compounding and E\ufb00ective Leverage). Consider an index that rises by 6%\non the \ufb01rst day and falls by 4% the next day; the two-period cumulative return is 1.76%. Now, if\nan investor holds a 2x leveraged ETF based on this index, they will initially gain 12% in returns\non the \ufb01rst day but then experience an 8% loss on the second. This compounding e\ufb00ect reduces\nthe e\ufb00ective leverage ratio to 3.04%/1.76% = 1.73, signi\ufb01cantly below the intended leverage of 2. This example highlights how LETFs can deviate from their target leverage over multiple periods\ndue to compounding, even when the underlying index experiences modest \ufb02uctuations. 3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nBelow, we de\ufb01ne the compounding e\ufb00ect as the di\ufb00erence between the cumulative return of an\nLETF and the corresponding multiple of the underlying ETF\u2019s cumulative return. Unlike prior\nstudies that focus solely on negative deviations and label them as volatility drag, see Avellaneda\nand Zhang (2010), Trainor Jr and Carroll (2013), we adopt a broader perspective by recognizing\nthat the compounding e\ufb00ect can be either positive or negative, depending on market conditions.

When \u03b2 is negative, these LETFs are called inverse ETFs. 2.2\nFees and Tracking Error Considerations\nReal-world LETFs incur annual expense fees, which can signi\ufb01cantly impact performance over\ntime. ETF fees are typically much smaller than LETF fees and tracking errors. Although ETF\nfees exist, they typically contribute only a marginal correction relative to the dominant e\ufb00ects in\nLETF performance. Henceforth, we take the ETF\u2019s daily return to be XETF\nt\n= Xt. The LETF\u2019s\ndaily return is modi\ufb01ed to include fees and tracking errors:\nXLETF\nt\n= \u03b2Xt \u2212f + et,\nwhere \u03b2 is the leverage ratio, f is the daily cost (incorporating expense ratio and transaction costs,\ne.g., f \u2248\n1\n252(fexpense + ftransaction), and et is a zero-mean tracking error with variance \u03c4 2. Theorem 2.1 (Expected Compounding E\ufb00ect Approximation). Let \u03b2 \u2208Z \\ {0}. Assume that the\nunderlying daily returns {Xt}t\u22651 is strictly stationary with mean \u00b5 = E[Xt] and autocorrelation\n\u03b3k = E[XtXt+k]. Let f denote the daily fee, and {et} be the tracking error and |Xt|, |f|, |et| \u2264M,\nfor some su\ufb03ciently small M \u226a1 with E[et] = E[etXs] = E[etes] = 0 for t \u0338= s.\nThen, the\n4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\ncompounding e\ufb00ect over n days satis\ufb01es\nE[CEn] = \u2212nf +\nn\u22121\nX\nk=1\n(n \u2212k) (\u03b2(\u03b2 \u22121)\u03b3k \u22122\u03b2f\u00b5) +\n\u0012n\n2\n\u0013\nf 2 + O(n3M3). Proof. See Appendix A.1. Remark 2.2.",
  "Proof. See Appendix A.1. Remark 2.2. (i) Theorem 2.1 shows that the expected compounding e\ufb00ect depends on autocor-\nrelation E[XtXs] = \u03b3|t\u2212s| rather than just volatility. If there are no fees and no tracking error,\ni.e., f = et = 0, then the \ufb01rst-order term vanishes. We obtain E[CEn] \u2248Pn\u22121\nk=1(n \u2212k)\u03b2(\u03b2 \u22121)\u03b3k,\nshowing that autocorrelation, not volatility, drives expected compounding; see Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2. Moreover, under the i.i.d. model \u03b3k = 0 for k \u22651, hence E[CEn] = \u2212nf, which is strictly negative\nonly because of costs. (ii) If there are nonzero fees f > 0 and nonzero tracking error et, then the\nfees contribute a \ufb01rst-order negative term \u2212nf, and the second-order correction further adjusts\nthe compounding e\ufb00ect. For realistic (small) values of f and \u03c4, these corrections will dampen the\ncompounding e\ufb00ect or even reverse its sign if costs are su\ufb03ciently high. 3\nCompounding E\ufb00ect Analysis: A Revisit\nThis section presents a comprehensive analysis of the compounding e\ufb00ect, examining how changes\nin key parameters\u2014leverage ratio, volatility, and rebalancing frequency\u2014a\ufb00ect LETF performance. By exploring these factors across independent, serially correlated return scenarios, as well as\ncontinuous-time regime switching models, we aim to provide actionable insights for managing\nLETFs under varying market conditions. To isolate the compounding e\ufb00ect, we henceforth as-\nsume there are no fees and no tracking error. 3.1\nSerially Independent Returns Case: A Discrete-Time Benchmark\nWe \ufb01rst analyze the compounding e\ufb00ect under the assumption of serially independent returns,\nrepresenting a baseline scenario in an idealized market. Speci\ufb01cally, we consider the case where\nthe returns of the underlying ETF, XETF\nt\n, are independent, with a common mean \u00b5 \u2208R and\nvariance \u03c32 > 0.",

Under\nthese circumstances, the following lemma indicates that the expected compounding e\ufb00ect is always\nnonnegative, regardless of the leverage ratio or the holding period.

(2)\nMoreover, if \u00b5 = 0, then E [CEn] = 0 for all n \u22651. 5\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nProof. See Appendix A. Remark 3.1.

  "See Appendix A. Remark 3.1. Lemma 3.1 implies that for independent returns, LETFs tend to outperform expec-\ntations regardless of the leverage ratio and holding period. This is also evident from the subsequent\nsimulation results in Section 4. If leverage is not allowed, i.e., \u03b2 = 1, then CEn = 0 with probability\none. Lastly, while the lemma proves this result for integer values of the leverage ratio \u03b2, in theory,\nit can take any real value; however, practical trading restricts \u03b2 to integers. 3.1.1\nMonte Carlo Simulations with Independent Return Model. To validate our result, we use daily adjusted closing price data for SPY, an ETF that tracks the\nS&P 500 index, spanning from January 1993 to December 2023 with about a total of 7,800 trading\ndays. SPY is chosen for its broad market representation and high liquidity, making it an ideal\ncandidate for evaluating LETF performance. Using this data, we estimate the daily returns and\ntheir standard deviation, which is approximately 1%. Compounding E\ufb00ect with Various Leverage Ratios.

Here, we consider \u03b2 \u2208{\u22122, \u22121, 2, 3}, which is commonly found in the market. 3Here, we only present the results when the leverage ratio \u03b2 = 2 since similar patterns are shown across di\ufb00erent\nleverage combinations, presenting a similar shape of their respective curves. 6\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nExpected Compounding Effect\nFigure 1: Simulated and Theoretical Compounding E\ufb00ect E[CEn] with Di\ufb00erent Leverage Ratios\n(Independent Return Case) where Theoretical E[CEn] is computed by Lemma 3.1 and Simulated\nE[CEn] is obtained via Monte Carlo simulations.

Rebalancing Frequency E\ufb00ects. Next, we analyze how the rebalancing frequency of LETFs\nin\ufb02uences the expected compounding e\ufb00ect by conducting simulations with daily, weekly, and\nmonthly rebalancing intervals. Using a daily volatility level of 1%, we compare the results across\ndi\ufb00erent rebalancing frequencies. The results in Figure 3 demonstrate that changing the rebalancing\nfrequency does not a\ufb00ect the compounding e\ufb00ect when returns are independent. This result suggests\nthat, in the absence of serial correlation, rebalancing frequency has minimal impact on LETF\nperformance. Consequently, under such conditions, investors may choose less frequent rebalancing\nstrategies to reduce transaction costs without sacri\ufb01cing performance. 3.1.2\nPortfolio Construction Implications: Independent Return Model. Under the frictionless independent returns benchmark, we can construct arbitrage-like portfolios by\ncombining long positions in LETFs with short positions in the corresponding ETFs.

The return of such a portfolio is\nRportfolio := RLETF\nn\n\u2212\u03b2RETF\nn\n= CEn\nand the expected return is simply E[Rportfolio] = E[CEn] > 0 under independence and \u00b5 \u0338= 0,\nas established in Lemma 3.1.",

To capture the temporal dependence, we begin with an\nautoregressive process of order 1 (AR(1)) model. 3.2.1\nReturns with AR(1) Model.

Then, the following statements hold:\n(i) If \u03c6 > 0, then E[CEn] > 0. (ii) If \u03c6 < 0, then E[CEn] < 0. Proof. See Appendix A.2. Remark 3.2.

Compounding E\ufb00ect with Di\ufb00erent Levels of Volatility. We examine how volatility modulates\nthe expected compounding e\ufb00ect in the presence of serial correlation among returns. As shown\nin Figure 5, increased volatility ampli\ufb01es the expected compounding e\ufb00ect when the AR coe\ufb03-\ncient \u03c6 > 0, re\ufb02ecting enhanced return potential under momentum-driven market conditions. In\nsuch scenarios, LETFs bene\ufb01t from larger price movements, as rebalancing adjustments amplify\nreturns in the direction of the trend. However, when the positive correlation weakens, increased\nvolatility introduces greater randomness, reducing the e\ufb00ectiveness of rebalancing. Conversely, when \u03c6 < 0, corresponding to mean-reverting markets, higher volatility exacerbates\nreturn \ufb02uctuations and induces performance drag. Rebalancing in this regime ampli\ufb01es exposure\nduring losses and suppresses it during recoveries, generating a pronounced negative compounding\ne\ufb00ect. These \ufb01ndings highlight the dual role of volatility: while it can enhance LETF performance\nin trending markets, it poses signi\ufb01cant risks in mean-reverting environments.

In contrast, when the AR coe\ufb03cient is negative (mean-reverting markets), frequent rebalancing\nbecomes detrimental, leading to a cycle of buying high and selling low. Interestingly, extending the\nrebalancing interval to a week reduces the negative compounding e\ufb00ect, while monthly rebalancing\nnearly eliminates it. These results suggest that in oscillating markets, less frequent rebalancing can\nmitigate performance drag, providing a strategic advantage to investors who choose LETFs with\nlonger rebalancing intervals.

Therefore, arbitrage-like portfolios based\non compounding asymmetry require careful calibration to prevailing volatility and autocorrelation\nregimes. 3.3\nCompounding E\ufb00ect for Continuous-Time Model\nThis section examines a continuous-time regime-switching model. Let St be the ETF price process\nthat evolves according to the regime-dependent geometric Brownian motion, see Di Masi et al.

(6)\nThe derivation of Equation (6) is relegated to Appendix A.3. Remark 3.3. (i) The source of autocorrelation is the persistence of the Markov state Zt: If\nP(Zt+1 = Zt) > 1/2, then the return process exhibits positive autocorrelation. Negative au-\ntocorrelation can be generated by alternating regimes (e.g., mean-reversion via switching between\nup/down trends). (ii) The continuous-time model implicitly assumes instantaneous and frictionless\nrebalancing, so that leverage is continuously maintained at level \u03b2.

Proof. See Appendix A.3. Remark 3.5 (Compounding E\ufb00ect Under Regime Switching).

This occurs because regime\nmixing destroys the directional coherence necessary for compounding to accumulate e\ufb00ectively. (ii) While GARCH models account for conditional heteroskedasticity, regime-switching models\ncapture drift and volatility persistence via state dynamics. Volatility clustering in AR-GARCH is\nmimicked in our model by allowing high-volatility states with persistent occupation probabilities.

The \ufb01nancial crisis (October 2007 to March 2009) and the subsequent post-crisis recovery\n(April 2009 to March 2013) provide contrasting phases of sharp decline and sustained growth. During the crisis, the S&P 500 index lost more than 50% of its value, falling from over 1500 to\nbelow 700 points. In response, the Federal Reserve introduced quantitative easing, fostering a\nlow-interest-rate environment that gradually fueled economic recovery. By 2013, the index had\nfully recovered to pre-crisis levels. As shown in Table 4, positive-leverage synthetic LETFs exhibit\npositive compounding e\ufb00ects in both recovery periods, particularly strong for \u03b2 = 3. For inverse\nLETFs (\u03b2 < 0), the compounding e\ufb00ects during the \ufb01nancial crisis are predominantly negative\nfor QQQ, while SPY shows mixed results with \u03b2 = \u22121 exhibiting a small positive compounding ef-\nfect, but negative e\ufb00ects for \u03b2 = \u22122 and \u03b2 = \u22123. This suggests that LETFs tend to outperform\nexpectations in strongly trending markets, making them attractive for trend following strategies. However, in mean-reverting markets, the e\ufb00ects di\ufb00er by market regime.

As\nshown in Table 5, empirical LETF performance during this period resembled that of the COVID-\n19 pandemic period. The compounding e\ufb00ect remained weak due to increased market uncertainty,\nand as expected, inverse LETFs continued to underperform due to tracking error accumulation. The sideways market (2014\u20132015) presents a unique challenge for LETFs, as frequent rebal-\nancing results in negative compounding e\ufb00ects. While most portfolios exhibited the negative com-\npounding e\ufb00ects, an exception arises for SQQQ, which yielded a small positive CE. This re\ufb02ects net\nupward drift in QQQ over the window. Frequent rebalancing leads to systematic buying high and\nselling low, which ampli\ufb01es losses over time. Although mean-reverting markets generally induce\nnegative compounding e\ufb00ects due to rebalancing drag, directional drift\u2014even if modest\u2014can yield\na net positive e\ufb00ect, as observed in SQQQ during 2014\u201315. Thus, H2 holds in expectation but may\nbe violated in certain drifting but volatile environments. A robustness check using QQQ-based LETFs, see Table 5, reveals similar trends but with stronger\ndeviations.

  "In summary, the empirical results support our theoretical hypotheses:\nH1 is con\ufb01rmed: LETFs outperform in strongly trending regimes, regardless of direction, due to\npath-dependent compounding. H2 holds broadly but admits exceptions: While most LETFs ex-\nhibit negative compounding e\ufb00ects in the sideways market as predicted, inverse LETFs occasionally\noutperform in \ufb02at markets with su\ufb03cient directional drift, as observed with SQQQ during 2014-15.

In\ncontrast, in serially correlated markets, LETF performance is sensitive to the autocorrelation, return\ndynamics, and the rebalancing interval. Daily rebalancing enhances returns in trending markets,\nwhereas weekly or monthly rebalancing mitigates losses in oscillating or mean-reverting regimes. Empirical validation using about 20 years of SPY and QQQ data across diverse market regimes\ncon\ufb01rms these predictions. LETFs exhibit positive compounding during directional trends, but\nunderperform in sideways markets where rebalancing erodes returns. For trend-following investors,\ndaily-rebalanced LETFs o\ufb00er superior performance. In contrast, when autocorrelation is weak or\nnegative, longer rebalancing intervals reduce performance decay. Future work could extend this\nframework by incorporating rough volatility models or non-Markovian regime-switching dynamics\nto capture \ufb01ner features of real-world return processes.

Combined with the four cases above, we conclude that f(\u03b2, \u00b5) \u22650 for all cases. Thus, the given\nstatement holds for any n \u2208N and \u03b2 \u2208Z \\ {0, 1}, which proves that the expected compounding\n30\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\ne\ufb00ect is always positive. A.2\nCompounding E\ufb00ect for Serially Correlated AR(1) Returns\nBelow, we shall work with the AR(1) model for {Xt : t \u22651}. Let \u03b2 \u2208Z \\ {0, 1}. For the two-period\ncase, we have that: (i) If \u03c6 > 0, then E[CE2] > 0 and (ii) If \u03c6 < 0, then E[CE2] < 0. To see this, we\nbegin by noting that\nCE2 = [(1 + \u03b2X1)(1 + \u03b2X2) \u22121] \u2212\u03b2[(1 + X1)(1 + X2) \u22121]\n= \u03b2(\u03b2 \u22121)X1X2. Taking the expectation on both sides yields: E[CE2] = \u03b2(\u03b2 \u22121)E[X1X2] = \u03b2(\u03b2 \u22121)\u03c6\n\u03c3\n1\u2212\u03c62 .",

Taking the expectation on both sides yields: E[CE2] = \u03b2(\u03b2 \u22121)E[X1X2] = \u03b2(\u03b2 \u22121)\u03c6\n\u03c3\n1\u2212\u03c62 . Note that\n\u03c3 > 0, and for \u03b2 \u2208Z \\ {0, 1}, the product \u03b2(\u03b2 \u22121) > 0. Therefore, to determine the sign of the\nexpected di\ufb00erence, it su\ufb03ces to check the sign of the \u03c6. Speci\ufb01cally, for \u03c6 > 0, then E[CE2] > 0. On the other hand, for \u03c6 < 0, then E[CE2] < 0. The following proof extends this result to the\nmulti-period case. Proof of Lemma 3.2.

  "The expected occupation measure PM\ni=1 \u03c0j(t) = 1\nfor all t \u22650. Proof of Lemma A.1. For every \ufb01xed sample point \u03c9 \u2208\u2126and any time s, the Markov chain is\nexactly one of the M states. Hence, for all s \u22650 and \u03c9 \u2208\u2126, PM\nj=1 1{Zs(\u03c9)=j} = 1. Hence, with the\n4In principle, one can compute E[exp(Xt)] and E[exp(Yt)] condition on given Zs = j. Then invoke the Feynman-\nKac theorem to solve the resulting PDEs, e.g., see Cvitanic and Zapatero (2004). However, solving the PDEs can be\ncomplex. 33\n\n\n--- Page 34 ---\naid of the Fubini-Tonelli theorem, we have\nM\nX\nj=1\n\u03c0j(t) =\nM\nX\nj=1\nE\n\u00141\nt\nZ t\n0\n1{Zs=j}ds\n\u0015\n= E\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\nM\nX\nj=1\n1\nt\nZ t\n0\n1{Zs=j}ds\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n= E\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f01\nt\nZ t\n0\nM\nX\nj=1\n1{Zs=j}ds\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n= E\n\u00141\nt\nZ t\n0\n1ds\n\u0015\n= E [1] = 1. Proof of Theorem 3.2. This is an immediate consequence of the approximation:\nE[CEt] \u2248\nX\nj\n\u03c0j(t)\u03a6j(t; \u03b2, f) + (\u03b2 \u22121)\nwhere \u03a6j(t; \u03b2, f) depends on both \u03b2 and \u00b5j. The sign of the convex combination P\nj \u03c0j(t)\u03a6j(t; \u03b2, f)\ndetermines the sign of CE, relative to the o\ufb00set (1 \u2212\u03b2). Proof of Corollary 3.1. This follows directly from Theorem 3.2. Fix f = 0. Note that for t = 0,\nE[CEt] = 0. Next, for t > 0, Take x := \u00b5jt \u2208R where x \u22650 if \u00b5j > 0 and x \u22640 if \u00b5j < 0, and\nx = 0 if \u00b5 = 0. Hence, it su\ufb03ces to show that h\u03b2(x) := exp (\u03b2x) \u2212\u03b2 exp(x) + (\u03b2 \u22121) \u22650 for all\nx \u2208R. We now consider two cases:\nCase 1.",
  "Next, for t > 0, Take x := \u00b5jt \u2208R where x \u22650 if \u00b5j > 0 and x \u22640 if \u00b5j < 0, and\nx = 0 if \u00b5 = 0. Hence, it su\ufb03ces to show that h\u03b2(x) := exp (\u03b2x) \u2212\u03b2 exp(x) + (\u03b2 \u22121) \u22650 for all\nx \u2208R. We now consider two cases:\nCase 1. For \u03b2 > 1, set the weights \u03bb1 := 1\n\u03b2, \u03bb2 := 1 \u22121\n\u03b2 then \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 = 1 and \u03bb1, \u03bb2 > 0. Since\nthe exponential function exp(\u00b7) is convex, applying the Jensen\u2019s inequality yields \u03bb1e\u03b2x + \u03bb2e0 \u2265\ne\u03bb1\u03b2x+\u03bb2\u00b70 = ex. Multiplying \u03b2 we obtain e\u03b2x \u2212\u03b2ex + (\u03b2 \u22121) \u22650 for all x \u2208R, which shows that\nE[CEt] \u22650 for all t \u22650 when \u03b2 > 1. Case 2. For \u03b2 < 0, Take \u03b2 := \u2212k with k \u2208N. Then, we obtain hk(x) := e\u2212kx + kex \u2212(k + 1). Note that the \ufb01rst derivative: h\u2032\nk(x) = \u2212ke\u2212kx + kex, which vanishes at x = 0. Moreover, its\nsecond-order derivative: h\u2032\u2032\nk(x) = k2e\u2212kx + kex > 0. Hence, hk is strictly convex and x = 0 is the\nunique global minimizer of hk. Value at the minimum is hk(0) = 1 + k \u2212(k + 1) = 0. Since the\nminimum value is 0, we have hk(x) \u22650 for every x \u2208R. Hence, it also implies that E[CEt] \u22650 for\nall t.\nLastly, we consider the degenerate case \u00b5 = 0. It implies that E[CEt] = e0 \u2212\u03b2e0 + (\u03b2 \u22121) = 0,\nwhich is desired. Therefore, in all cases, E[CEt] \u22650 for all t \u22650 and equality holds when t = 0, or\nwhen \u00b5 = 0. 34"
