Firstly, we describe the economic model of a linear city to show how depth can\ngenerate value by creating local monopolies in less integrated spaces. Then, a new syntactic\nmeasure, the d-value, is proposed to capture the relation between the depth of some space\nfrom outside and the mean depth of all spaces from outside. An application to a public\nhousing estate suggests that economic activities and services may be located in spaces with\na d-value close to one. The article is complemented by a Prolog programme with a special\npredicate to compute the d-value.

It was developed\noriginally by Bill Hillier, Julienne Hanson, and colleagues at the Bartlett School of Architecture\nand Planning, University College of London (UCL) since the 1970s.

Space syntax is mainly concerned with the study of the relations between convex spaces. Convexity exists when straight lines can be drawn from any point in a space to any other\npoint in it without leaving the space itself (Hillier and Hanson, 1984). In fact, convex spaces\nrather than concave spaces stimulate social interaction in the sense that everyone sees everyone\nwithin that kind of space. Thus, the starting point of a syntactic analysis is typically a map\nof the fattest convex and open (or permeable) spaces that cover the settlement (or building) in\nquestion. Then, several syntactic measures can be computed to explore the connectivity and\nasymmetry between convex spaces or the minimum set of axial lines that covered them. In this scope, the notion of depth is concerned with the number of intervening spaces through\nwhich it is necessary to go to get from one space to another (Hillier and Hanson, 1984). The\ndeepest or asymmetric spaces are typically located at the end or limit of a complex because\nwe may have to take several steps to reach the other spaces.",

In contrast, integrated spaces are\ntypically located in the \u2019middle\u2019 of the settlement. Thus, depth has an economic meaning in the\nsense that it represents the cost of moving between spaces. In fact, the most valuable spaces\ntypically have a small mean depth, that is, we do not need to take too much steps from them\nto get the other spaces in the complex. The economic meaning of integration can be found in the high rents typically paid in the\ncentral business district (CBD) of most towns, or in neighbourhoods well connected with high-\nways or railways. However, depth itself can have an economic value. In addition to the value\nof peace and quiet, suburban consumers may be willing to pay higher prices for goods sold near\ntheir homes to avoid freight or commuting costs or because they like local stores. This kind of\nvalue is not captured by typical syntactic measures.",

Then, a new syntactic\nmeasure is proposed, the d-value, to capture the economic value of depth. An application to a\npublic housing estate located in Odivelas, Portugal, used Prolog, a logic programming language\ndeveloped in the 1970s (Colmerauer and Roussel, 1993), to illustrate how the d-value can be\neasily computed. Prolog applies logic to represent knowledge and uses deduction to solve problems by deriving\nlogical consequences (Kowalski, 1988). A corollary of using logic to represent knowledge is that\nsuch knowledge can be understood declaratively. This kind of reasoning is embodied in space\nsyntax when it represents spatial arrangements as a field of knowables, that is, as a system of\npossibilities governed by a simple and underlying system of concepts (Hillier and Hanson, 1984). A comprehensive description of the application of logic programming to space syntax can be\nfound in Fernandes (2023).",

However, if only A is connected with a third space C, as in the right-hand side of the same\nfigure, A and B become asymmetrical in relation to C because we have to pass through A to\nget to B from C, but we do not have to pass through B to get to A from C. Thus, asymmetry\nrelates to depth, that is, with the number of spaces (or steps) necessary to go from a certain\nspace, say C, to another space, A (1 step), B (2 steps), and so on.

If we count the number of steps necessary to go from a certain space to every other space in\na complex, we can obtain a measure of its total depth (TD), or mean depth (MD) by dividing\nthat total by the number of spaces in the complex minus one, the original space (Hillier and\nHanson, 1984) (Hanson, 1998). In the previous example, the total depth of C is 3, which is the\nsum of steps to reach A and B (1 + 2) from that origin. This is also the case for B, but the total\ndepth of A is 2, noting that this (central) space is directly connected to the spaces B or C (1 +\n1). Thus, the mean depth is 1 (2/2) for A and 1.5 (3/2) for B or C, noting that the number of\nspaces minus one in this simple complex is 2 (3 \u22121). This simple illustration suggests that syntactic measures can be computed for every convex\nspace in a settlement (or building).",

Then, we may eventually find that some spaces have a lower\ndepth than all other spaces (A in the same example), and others have a greater depth (B and\nC). The former are the most integrated spaces, where social life may be concentrated in cities\n(Heitor and Pinelo Silva, 2015). The latter are typically the most segregated, quiet, or remote\nspaces in a complex. Thus, integration is inversely related to depth. It is a global measure in\nthe sense that it considers the configuration of a certain space in relation to all other spaces. In\naddition, local measures such as control are based on the relations between each space and only\nthe spaces directly connected to it (Turner, 2004).",

Traditionally, high spatial integration of the street network is a sufficient condition for eco-\nnomic centrality (van Nes and Yamu, 2022). Thus, the places where trade, shopping, and\nfinances take place may be the most integrated streets on a local or global scale. Accessibility,\nvisibility, permeability, and connectivity to direct side streets are also necessary conditions for\nthe concentration of stores. However, as the following model suggests, depth can protect local\nmarkets, especially with high transportation costs. Thus, asymmetry can favour profits. 3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n3\nModel\nThe linear city economic model was originally developed by Harold Hotelling (1929) to deal with\nthe instability of the duopoly model, where a small change in the price of either company takes\naway all the opponent\u2019s business.

Each consumer is indifferent between buying from A or B except in terms of price\nplus transportation cost between the store A or B and her home at a cost c per unit of distance. If store A wants to sell something, its price p1 should be below p2 plus the transportation cost\nfrom store B, that is, p1 < p2 + c(l \u2212a \u2212b). In this case, store A sells the quantity a plus the\nquantity x which depends on the difference between prices p1 and p2. Similarly, store B sells b\nplus y if p2 < p1 + c(l \u2212a \u2212b). Once again, y is a function of the difference between prices. Thus, stores are monopolists at the respective end of the line: A gets the demand a, and\nB the demand b.

As Hotelling (1929)\nsaid: \u201dThe intermediate segment of the market acts as a cushion as well as a bone of contention;\nwhen it disappears we have Cournot\u2019s case, and Bertrand\u2019s objection applies\u201d. 4\nImplications\nWhat are the implications of Hotelling\u2019s model on space syntax? Despite its simplicity and\ntheoretic nature, Hotelling\u2019s model suggests that depth can matter in the sense that a less\nintegrated space can provide local demand and less competition for firms located there. Central\nor integrated spaces are typically very tough: In addition to high rents, companies may have\nto lower their prices to sell their goods and services. In contrast, peripheral locations can offer\nhigher profits. However, companies located in very deep locations may only get a small portion\nof the total market, such as firm B in Figure 2 which gets b << a. Thus, a good location may be\nan intermediate point between the middle and end of the settlement, keeping some intermediate\nspace between stores.",

Thus, a good location may be\nan intermediate point between the middle and end of the settlement, keeping some intermediate\nspace between stores. This evidence suggests a new syntactic measure, d-value, that captures the relation between\nthe depth of some space from outside (Do) and the mean depth of all spaces from outside (MDo),\nthat is,\nd-value =\nDo\nMDo\n. (10)\nIn this framework, a d-value close to 0 means that the space is too close to the end of the\nsettlement, where the market dimension may be tiny. In contrast, a d-value greater than 1\nmeans that the space is located close to the centre of the settlement, where competition may\nbe hard. Ideally, the space should have a d-value close to 1, which means that its depth from\noutside is roughly equal to the mean depth from outside. 5\nApplication\nBairro Gulbenkian (figure 3) is a public housing estate built in the late 1960s in Odivelas, near\nLisbon, Portugal.

Composed of 15 isolated\nblocks with three storeys and a total of 160 dwellings (about 600 inhabitants), Bairro Gulbenkian\nis a good case for testing and developing new syntactic methods. Figure 3: Bairro Gulbenkian: aerial photograph. The axial map of Bairro Gulbenkian (figure 4) reveals that the maximum depth from the\noutside is 2, that is, the lines that cover its convex spaces are one or two steps away from the\nend of the settlement. The mean depth from the outside (MDo) is 1.32. It can be easily computed with the Prolog\nprogramme available at https://swish.swi-prolog.org/p/gulbenkian.pl (accessed on 12\nJune 2025) by asking the following query:\n?-meandepth(outside,Y,D,MD).
